Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
what is an Array?
--An array is a data type which can store multiple values in a variable. 
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
--An Array has to be declared with a fixed length, whereas an ArrayList is not limited to its length in storing data.
what is LinkedList?
How is an Array different from Linked List?
what is queue?
what is stack?
what is FIFO and LIFO?
what is the order of complexity?
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
what is tree in data structure?
--A tree is a collection where there is a child-parent relationship
what is graph in data structure?
--A graph is a collection where multiple nodes can connect to another, unlike a parent-child relationship.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
--A HashTable is synchronized and does not accept any null keys or values. A HashMap is unsynchronized and accepts one key as null, and unlimited values as null.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
--ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is an exception where an index which does not exist in an array is called. This can happen when the index number is either less than or equal to zero, or when the index number is greater than or equal to the length of the array.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
--Recursion is when a method calls itself. This can result in a loop. 
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
--Graph and Tree are non-linear data structures. List, Set, and Queue are linear data structures.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outline different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
