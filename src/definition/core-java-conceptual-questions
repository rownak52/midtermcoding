Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programming language?
A. Programming language is a set of rules in sending instructions to a machine to perform specific tasks.


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK contains JRE (Java Runtime Environment), JVM (Java Virtual Machine), an archiver (jar), a compiler (javac), 
	a documentation generator (javadoc), and an interpreter/loader.


What is IDE?
A. IDE is an Integrated Development Environment aiding to writing code.


What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. Eclipse, IntelliJ, and NetBeans.


Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. The .java source file is compiled by Java Compiler. After getting compiled into a bytecode file, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what is class?
A. Class is a blueprint for an object in Java.


What is object?
A. An object is the instance of a class.


What is the entry point of an application?
A. The main method is the entry point of an application.


Why is main static?
A. The main is static so that the compiler can call the main method without having to create an object.


Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. The Object class is the superclass of all classes.


What is the difference between path and classpath variables?
A. -----------------------------------------------------


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. Classes use Abstract class by using the keyword "extends", whereas an interface is used by using the keyword "implements".
	While there are no default constructors in either, the interface methods are public by default, and interface variables are final.
	An abstract class's internal memory is faster.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it?
A. You cannot create an object of an interface OR an abstract class. 
	We can use an interface by implementing it to a class and instantiating that class,
	and by inheriting from the abstract class and overriding its abstract methods. This allows us to instantiate the subclass. 


what is Access Specifier?
A. Access specifier/modifier is a java entity that helps us to restrict the scope of a package, class, constructor, method, variable,
	or other data. They are public, private, protected, and default.


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming. The features of OOPs are Polymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritance, , and Encapsulation.
	Polymorphism is used for method hiding. This includes method overloading and method overriding.
	Method overloading is when we have the same method name as the parent class, but we pass different parameters to make it an entirely different method.
	Method overriding is when we have the same method name and same method parameters as the parent class, but a different body. 
	We have to use the @override annotation for the child class method in method override.
	Abstraction is used for implementation hiding.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. A Java package is used to group related classes together into a folder for easier access and efficiency. 
	The java.lang package is internally imported by default into every class.


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. ------------------------------------------------------


Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. Java does not support multiple inheritance because if both parent classes contain methods with the same signature,
	the compiler won't know which method is called upon. 


What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. Method overloading is when we use the same method name as a parent class method, but with different parameters. 


Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. An exception in java is an error existing in the code of an application. This can be either a checked/compile time exception,
	or an unchecked/runtime exception. We can handle exceptions by either using the 'throws' keyword, or a try-catch block.


What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. The static keyword is used in java to make an attribute a part of a class. 
	It can be called using the class name and doesn't require creating an object. 
	Static has been used in variables to keep a class value constant, never allowing it to be reassigned.
	A static method is used to access only other static methods and data. Which allows the method to change even a static value.


What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A. final is a keyword in Java that does not allow any further reassignment or overriding of a variable or method once used. 
	A final variable is used to keep a constant value, which is a part of the class. 
	A final method can only call/use other final methods or variables. This allows a final variable's manipulation.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A. final is a keyword in java that finalizes a method or variable value from being reassigned or overriden once the keyword is used.
	finally is a keyword used during exception handling at the end of the try and catch block. 
	Regardless of the try or catch block successfully executing, the finally block will always execute. 
	finalize is a method that the garbage collector always calls before deletion/destroy


What is a constructor ?
A. A constructor is a block of code similar to a method. It's initialized during object creation. 


Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. Yes, we can have multiple constructors in a class. This can be achieved when the constructors assign the class fields in different ways.


If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. When we don't have a constructor declared, the default constructor is called during object creation.


What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is JVM stand for ?
A. JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine


Is JVM platform independent?
A. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

What version of java are you using?
A. I am using Java version 8


What is JAR stand for ?
A. JAR stands for Java Archive. It's a package file format. 


What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is compile time and run time?
A. Compile time is when the code is being converted to machine code by the java compiler.
	Runtime is when the code is being executed, generally after compile time.


What is heap?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

when to use transient variable in java?
A. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A. The difference between the while loop and the do-while is that the do-while will always loop at least once no matter what. 
	If the conditions of a while loop are not met, there is a chance for the while loop to never run. 
	But because the do-while loop has its 'do' code block first, before its condition within the while block, this loop will always run at least once.


What is Enum?
A. ENUM is a nonprimitive data type whose fields consist of a fixed set of constants. 


What is Iterator?
A. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what is multithreading in java?
A. Multithreading in java is when you can execute multiple threads within a file. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A. The use of synchronization in Java is to protect a method against errors that may come up in multithreading. 
	Synchronization allows only one thread at a time to enter and execute a method. 
	This way another thread won't enter a method at the same time as one thread, and manipulate the values before the first thread is complete.

What is Framework?
A. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the testing Framework available in java?
A. Some of the different testing frameworks available in Java are Selenium, JUnit, Cucumber, and TestNG.


Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A. testNG was inspired by jUnit and has similar functionalities as jUnit. Unlike jUnit, testNG is able to run parallel tests.


What are the dependencies for this project?
A. The dependencies for this project are mysql, org.mongodb, and two versions of junit (4.12 and 4.13.2)


what is dependency injection in java?
A. Dependency Injection is the concept of objects getting other objects from outside.
